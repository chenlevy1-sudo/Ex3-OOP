------------- ImagePadder (in package image) -----------------

The ImagePadder class is a stateless utility responsible for performing step 1.4.2.1 of the assignment —
padding an input image so that both its width and height become powers of two.
Padding rules:
Padding is added using white pixels.
Padding is distributed symmetrically between opposite sides whenever possible.
Each dimension is padded independently to the smallest power of two greater than or equal to the original value.
If no padding is required, the original image is returned unchanged.
Public API:
Image pad(Image source)
Input:
An Image instance representing the original bitmap.
Output:
A new Image whose dimensions are powers of two and which contains the original image centered inside a white background.
Design notes:
The class is stateless (no fields), following OOP principles and Single-Responsibility.
Image construction uses the provided constructor Image(Color[][] pixelArray, int width, int height).



------------- ImageSlitter (in package image) -----------------

The ImageSplitter class is a stateless utility responsible for step 1.4.2.2 of the assignment:
splitting a padded input image into equal square sub-images according to a given resolution.

The resolution parameter represents the number of sub-images (characters) in each row of the final ASCII output.
Since the padded image width is guaranteed to be divisible by this value, the splitter computes:

the pixel side length of each square block:
blockSize = paddedImageWidth / resolution

the number of block rows:
numRows = paddedImageHeight / blockSize

the number of block columns:
numCols = resolution

The public API:

Image[][] split(int resolution, Image imageToSplit)


The method returns a 2D array of Image objects.
Each element is a square sub-image of size blockSize × blockSize,
and the 2D structure preserves the spatial layout of the original image (rows and columns).
This layout is required in the next stage, where each sub-image is converted into a single ASCII character.

The class contains private helper methods for extracting each block,
keeping the public interface clean and aligned with the Single Responsibility Principle.
It stores no internal state and does not modify the input image.
